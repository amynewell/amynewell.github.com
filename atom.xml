    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve tech-blogged. A few years. In the meantime I&#8217;ve been busy coding for work, raising my kids, dealing with some nasty personal crap I won&#8217;t go into, writing other blogs I won&#8217;t link to here, because there&#8217;s very little chance you&#8217;re interested in their content, and generally living life in other ways than by writing about tech. Maybe that&#8217;s led to a little bit of stagnation. I hope not. But it seems like a good time to start up again. I&#8217;ve recently bitten off a few new projects, and I may as well chronicle them here. Should keep me honest, in any case. &#8220;But Amy, you <strong>said</strong> on your blog you were working on that thing&#8230;&#8221; And I&#8217;m learning a ton of new (to me, anyway) tech right now and want to share the resources that have been helpful and those that have not been so helpful. So anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>More to come, soon.</p>
