It's been a long time since I've tech-blogged. A few years. In the meantime I've been busy coding for work, raising my kids, dealing with some nasty personal crap I won't go into, writing other blogs I won't link to here, because there's very little chance you're interested in their content, and generally living life in other ways than by writing about tech. Maybe that's led to a little bit of stagnation. I hope not. But it seems like a good time to start up again. I've recently bitten off a few new projects, and I may as well chronicle them here. Should keep me honest, in any case. "But Amy, you **said** on your blog you were working on that thing..." And I'm learning a ton of new (to me, anyway) tech right now and want to share the resources that have been helpful and those that have not been so helpful. So anyway...

More to come, soon.
